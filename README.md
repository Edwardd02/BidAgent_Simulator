Problems Attempt to solve:  
1. What is the most effective bidding strategy for  a bidder to use in different types of auctions (e.g., first-price  sealed-bid, second-price sealed-bid)?
2. How do different auction formats affect the final sale price of items  and the success rate of different bidding strategies?
3. Bidders' Behavior Analysis: How do different factors, such as the  number of participants, their budget constraints, and their valuation  of the auctioned item, affect their bidding strategies and the  auction's outcome?
4. Optimal Reserve Price Setting: For the auctioneer, what is the  optimal reserve price (the minimum acceptable price) that maximizes  revenue without deterring competitive bidding?

Game theory application: different auction strategy that bidders may apply.
Probablity and Distribution application: how the different strategy distributed within bidders?  How the initial capitals distributed?

Based on my understanding from the classes so far, the model involves agents or bidders who engage in random walks according to a specific rule: each agent has a unique probability of taking steps of varying sizes, influenced by the actions of others. The agent occupying the  highest position remains stationary. If, after more than three rounds, no agent surpasses the highest position, the agent in that position wins the  auction and secures the product. The positions of the agents represent  the prices they are willing to pay for the product in that auction round. However, only the agent at the highest position has the opportunity to set a price. Given the inherent unpredictability of human psychology, the step size chosen by an agent is likely to follow a normal distribution. Therefore, a model incorporating random steps influenced by other agents offers a practical approach to simulating this scenario.
