# MATH-2121---Spring-2024-Project
Problems Attempt to solve:  
1. What is the most effective bidding strategy for  a bidder to use in different types of auctions (e.g., first-price  sealed-bid, second-price sealed-bid)?
2. How do different auction formats affect the final sale price of items  and the success rate of different bidding strategies?
3. Bidders' Behavior Analysis: How do different factors, such as the  number of participants, their budget constraints, and their valuation  of the auctioned item, affect their bidding strategies and the  auction's outcome?
4. Optimal Reserve Price Setting: For the auctioneer, what is the  optimal reserve price (the minimum acceptable price) that maximizes  revenue without deterring competitive bidding?

This project aims to establish a simplified model using MATLAB to simulate bidder behavior in various auctions, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming.
